# qself-brandur [![Build Status](https://github.com/brandur/qself-brandur/workflows/qself-brandur%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/brandur/qself-brandur/actions)

Repo containing user-specific data files which are automatically updated through CI runs. See also [qself](https://github.com/brandur/qself).

**Update Dec 2023:** I've left the repository running for now, but every API that it'd been using is gone now so nothing useful is coming through. Strava started requiring stateful refresh tokens. Twitter closed their API behind a paywall. Goodreads retired their API, and although my access token still works for now, it returns unreliable and incomplete data. The open web is closing.
