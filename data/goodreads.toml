Troubled Blood is a solid mystery that's much more procedural than your traditional \"genius\" detective genre, with a lot of it being through-the-paces talking to people, studying material, and trying at length to connect dots. It's also about the detectives themselves, and their relationship with each other. It comes together well at the end, but I found it a little more prolonged than it had to be."

Unfortunately, those overtones impact the story in negative ways. e.g. How convenient that every surviving human being fits so cleanly in the good camp or the evil camp. e.g. If you pay attention, you'll notice that none of the protagonists actually do much of anything to resolve the plot, especially in the back half of the book.

Sections are interspersed with dialog between Polo and the Khan. I had a hard time rating this one because while the prose is wonderful, the writing suggests a profundity of hidden depth (in the themes of the cities of each section, or the relationship between the different \"categories\" of city), but it's not clear whether that depth actually exists. It's either a 3 or 4 star book, and worth reading not only because it's good, but also because it's short and to the point."

It hits the sweet spot between good narrative and mystery — the entire time you're reading, you're racking your brain trying to figure out what's going on as the text segments never quite convey enough information. By the end, you're constructed a view of the story and the world that's partially complete, but with gaps that are purposely left unknown and up to the reader's interpretation. As with other works by Stålenhag, I'm rating this one well because it's excellent for what it is, but keep in mind it's a fairly short work, with a reading time of ~1 hour."

Rowling proves just how good popular fiction can be — at the risk of sounding dramatic, a society where the mainstream admires book like these with intricate storylines, three dimension characters, and creativity in droves is the best version of humanity that we can hope for. _The Deathly Hallows_ also prove against the grain that it's possible to produce a strong end to a series even where expectations are higher than the moon — something that's easy to forget with recent, popular fumbles like _Game of Thrones_. Its pacing is great (read: not all just a long action scene), it provides a new level of lore for the world (the idiosyncrasies of wand ownership), and the story reads like it was planned out from the beginning (a much higher bar than it appears to be)."

The Nilgaardian Empire is a fearfully plausible menace.

Most others seem to be chasing much more questionable values like maintaining an illusion of work that's really just frantic busy-ness, or hyper-growth-at-all-costs which leads to a top-heavy pyramid that's 95% communication and 5% productive progress. I, for one, appreciate that."

Most travel adventure books are a mixed bag of mildly amusing anecdotes or situations that have been exaggerated to the point of fiction for dramatic effect, but Paul's narrative is light on that, and his quirky encounters are legitimately funny. There's enough books about travel in Japan that for all intents and purpose they're their own genre at this point, and if that's the case, this is one of the best I've read therein."

  review = "Worth the read for the many historical anecdotes that it covers, both from ancient history and that which is much more recent. Ferguson is an expert historian and it really comes through. His take on more modern events is also refreshingly pragmatic — he doesn't fall into the trap of expressing undue optimism about everything to be more palatable to the general public and sell more book copies. For example, the chapter that shows how states trend toward becoming heavily bureaucratic and thus capture monstrous amounts of potential productivity in massive overhead should be mandatory reading for anyone living in a democratic country.\n\nMy one complaint about the book is by going back through many key historical events in history and retrofitting the \"hierarchy versus network\" dichotomy onto them, the author ends up cheapening his own ideas. Many of the comparisons feel forced and/or unnecessary."

Unfortunately, something about the pacing is a little off, and I never got to the point where I was a reading it fluently. Its worse fault is its obfuscated prose — about 50 manufactured words are thrown at the reader right from the beginning (gogol, q-dot, Sobornost, quptlink, phoboi, tzaddikim, Oubliette, zoku, gevulot, etc.), and entire paragraphs are unintelligble. By the end of the book you've built up a rough feeling as to what most of it means, but even by then, the majority have never really been adequately explained. It's possible for a book to do a great job with some artificial vocabulary, but there's too much of it."

Meditation is discussed in depth, along with what we understand about how it affects the brain.

  review = "\"Walkaway\" is further proof that nobody thinks about the future like Cory Doctorow does. The imagined future isn't just possible, but feels within reach, and is modeled on a trajectory that originates from the author's keen sense of technology today. Many of its elements are pulled directly from ideas that we have today like wikis, anonymizers, version control, gamification, etc. and extended to produce an impressive vista that manages to be both utopian and dystopian at the same time.\n\nI'm giving it a lower rating mostly because all the characters are so insufferable. The highly embellished banter gets tiring to read after a while, and you just find yourself wishing that Cory would pick up a few habits from Cormac McCarthy. The book is also heavy handed on political statements: everyone's on the LGBT spectrum, and every female character is a Mary Sue incarnate. It's not the worst thing in the world, but it all comes off quite contrived."

He also goes into some interesting details around comparable projects in New York, Paris, and even Houston.\n\nI downrated it a little bit because while talking about specific projects was interesting and the despite the project's broad thesis, he doesn't present a cohesive strategy that will do anything than apply a few bandaids on a problem of true national scale."

However, the core precepts would have done much better as a short book or lengthy essay. The book is packed to the brim with personal anecdotes, random opinions, and information on unrelated topics that seem to mostly be there to flesh out the page count. These all contribute to a diluted signal, and not much comes out which is either actionable or significantly meaningful."

  review = "Dhalgren has the special distinction of being the worst book I've ever read — and not even by a little bit, but by a lot. Twenty pages in I could tell that I wanted to quit, but kept going. Fifty pages in I was bored. A hundred pages in, my stomach was churning. Two hundred pages in, I was disgusted. Five hundred pages in, I'd reached a state of zen wherein my eyes skimmed hundreds of words per minute of the most contemptible prose ever committed to paper, while still maintaining some semblance of mental integrity.\n\nDhalgren is proof that no matter how bad a book is, there will be self-proclaimed aficionados who will champion it as great literature only because it's so dense that it's inaccessible to the majority of the population. It's not about the quality of text, it's about how being in an appreciating minority unlocks access to a feeling of exclusive superiority. Dhalgren doesn't have a single redeeming quality — there's no cohesive plot, no moment of awe at it comes to a conclusion, not a single interesting character, and the only word that can be accurately applied to describe the dialog throughout is \"garbage\".\n\nHere's some of the most practical good advice that you'll get in your lifetime: read the plot synopsis in Wikipedia, and stop there. It's actually a little on the long side because every one of the book's original ideas can be easily summed up in three sentences. Use the dozens of hours you saved yourself from slogging through 800+ pages of one of the worst books ever written to do literally anything else: make love, write your novel, run a marathon, go to the gym. Or not. Spend the time playing video games, curating your bottle cap collection, watching mind-numbing reality TV, or just staring up at the sky and likening the shape of clouds to Simpsons characters, and it will still have been put to use infinitely more wisely than reading Dhalgren."

The only thing lacking was a plausible narrative; it details an incident, but then has the protagonist proceed to mostly bumble his way around as the leaders of the time randomly request his presence in various impromptu meetings (and this pattern lasts for the rest of the book). Still well worth reading though."

Of particular interest is the chapter and some of the color lent to Steve Jobs, inside information on what happened during some of Pixar's popular movies (and also on others that didn't even ship), and the history surrounding their rocky start and eventual blossoming as one of the darlings of the industry.\n\nA large section of the book involves standard post-success justification which Catmull generally attributes to their innovative management and hiring techniques. It's worth being a little bit skeptical here because a lot of it reads like typical executive motivational rhetoric straight out of the 80s and 90s, and of course that it's not actually possible to actually prove this causation."

  review = "Clearly Carriger's recipe for this book was Pride and Prejudice mixed with Twilight and a little steampunk thrown in to make the setting a tad more original. Final product makes Twilight look a literary accomplishment.\n\nThe author spends so much time describing how characters are stereotypes through statements, rather than have those characters actually behave in that way. e.g. \"The love interest is super manly,\" \"the vampire friend is so gay,\" \"the second-in-command of the wolf pack is that tweed jacket professor type,\" \"Tarabotti is SUCH a witty conversationalist that no one messes with her,\" \"the American scientist is a weak man.\" It's tiring to read.\n\nThe romance is in a league of its own. The love interest is rich, an earl, big and strong, head of the werewolf pack, head of the government's supernatural division, Scottish, gruff, and the over-idealized definition of manly in every respect. His interest in the heroine is apparently that she is such a clever conversationalist (again, stated many times, but never proved through dialog) and isn't afraid to challenge and question himself, or anyone, including the Queen of England. Pulp romance at its best.\n\nThis novel by itself was enough to convince me to completely ignore Goodreads' ratings for choosing books to read. At just under 4 stars, this book is rated significantly better than tens of thousands of far superior works."

Allies of Locke are too good to be true, and bad guys just don't seem evil enough or well motivated."
